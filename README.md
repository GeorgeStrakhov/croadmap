# CROADMAP

__collaborative roadmaps for anything__

## Why?
In making anything, shared vision is important.
Sharing your vision not only with your team but with all other stakeholders (including first and foremost your customers) is crucial to getting everything aligned, prioritized and scheduled correctly. Currently there is no easy way for a project team (let's say a software company) to share their ever-evolving roadmap with their community, to engage their customers in the decisions they are making. This could be made better.

## CROADMAP 

Croadmap is collaborative roadmap as a service.

Here is how it works:

1. You create your roadmap (a prioritized list of things that you want to execute)
2. You share it with your team and your community and ask them to upvote the tasks they believe are most critical, as well as (optionally) suggest their own ideas. You should think of hiring people who repeatedly suggest good ideas.
3. You can enable your customers to "vote with their money" - i.e. bid for how much more they would be willing to pay for your product if only a certain feature existed.
4. As a result of this ongoing process - you always know what seems most important not only to you and your team, but to your customers as well.
5. The atmosphere of transparency and co-creation fosters a more engaged community.
6. You end up with a lean product that only does what people really want... and with an engaged community of users that is built on mutual trust, respect and absolute transparency.

## User Epics

* As a product manager, I want a simple way to keep track of ideas about my product, so that good ideas never get lost.
* As a product manager, I need a simple way to prioritize features that customers will really value.
* As a product manager, I want to test incremental value potential of each feature before embarking on a long and expensive journey of building it.
* As a product user I want to understand the vision behind the product and have a sense of where it is going to and what development I can expect in the future.
* As a product user I want to have an easy way to communicate back to the developer my feature requests or other ideas about the product (and be rewarded for that?).
